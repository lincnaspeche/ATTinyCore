## Gameplay Tips for Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition
 
Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition is not an easy game, especially for beginners. The game has a complex combat system that requires strategic thinking and careful planning. The game also has a lot of hidden secrets, optional quests, and powerful enemies that can surprise you at any moment. To help you survive and thrive in this game, here are some gameplay tips that you should keep in mind:

- Save often. The game does not have an autosave feature, so you should save your progress manually as frequently as possible. You never know when you might encounter a deadly trap, a tough boss, or a game-breaking bug. You can save up to 10 different files, so use them wisely.
- Pause often. The game allows you to pause the game at any time by pressing the spacebar. This is very useful for issuing commands to your party members, checking your inventory, or assessing the situation. You can also adjust the game settings to automatically pause the game under certain conditions, such as when an enemy is sighted, when a party member is injured, or when a spell is cast.
- Use the quick slots. The game has six quick slots for each party member that you can access by pressing the corresponding number keys. You can assign items, spells, or abilities to these slots for easy access during combat. For example, you can assign healing potions, offensive spells, or defensive skills to these slots and use them without opening the inventory or the spellbook.
- Explore everything. The game has a huge world to explore, with many hidden areas, secret passages, and optional quests. You can find valuable loot, experience points, or allies by exploring every corner of the map. You can also learn more about the lore and the history of the Forgotten Realms by talking to NPCs, reading books, or finding clues.
- Rest often. Resting is essential for restoring your health and mana, as well as memorizing new spells. You can rest by clicking on the campfire icon on the bottom right corner of the screen. However, resting is not always safe, as you might be ambushed by enemies or interrupted by events. You should rest in safe areas, such as inns or temples, or use spells or items that protect you from harm while resting.

Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition is a rewarding game that offers a lot of fun and challenge for RPG fans. By following these gameplay tips, you can make your journey easier and more enjoyable.
