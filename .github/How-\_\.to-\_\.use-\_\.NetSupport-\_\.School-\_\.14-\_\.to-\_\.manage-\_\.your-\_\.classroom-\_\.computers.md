To use NetSupport School 14, you need to install two components: the Tutor Console on the teacher's computer, and the Student Client on each student's computer.

The Tutor Console is where you can manage your classroom computers and perform various tasks. It consists of four main areas: the toolbar, the control window, the status bar and the work area.
