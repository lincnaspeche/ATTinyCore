The Book of Enoch was originally written in Aramaic or Hebrew, but it was translated into Greek, Latin, and other languages. The oldest surviving fragments of the book date back to the second century BC. However, the complete text of the book was preserved only in Ge'ez, the classical language of Ethiopia. The Ge'ez version of the book is known as áá½áá ááá­ (Mashafa Henok) or áá½áá áá±áµ (Mashafa Qidus), meaning "the holy book".
 
The Book of Enoch consists of five main sections: the Book of the Watchers, the Book of Parables, the Book of the Heavenly Luminaries, the Book of Dream Visions, and the Epistle of Enoch. The book covers topics such as the fall of the angels, the judgment of the wicked, the coming of the Messiah, the resurrection of the dead, and the secrets of nature and history.

The Book of Enoch is divided into five main sections: the Book of the Watchers, the Book of Parables, the Book of the Heavenly Luminaries, the Book of Dream Visions, and the Epistle of Enoch. Each section has its own themes and style, and some are more ancient than others.
 
- The Book of the Watchers (chapters 1â36) tells the story of how some angels, called the Watchers, descended to earth and corrupted humanity by teaching them forbidden arts and by mating with human women. The offspring of these unions were the Nephilim, giant and wicked creatures who oppressed mankind. Enoch, a righteous man, was chosen by God to intercede for the Watchers and their children, but his pleas were rejected. God then sent a great flood to destroy the Nephilim and punish the Watchers. Enoch was also shown various secrets of heaven and earth, such as the names and functions of the angels, the geography of the world, and the movements of the stars.
- The Book of Parables (chapters 37â71) contains three parables that describe the fate of the righteous and the wicked in the present and future world. The first parable deals with the coming of the Son of Man, a mysterious figure who will judge all people and establish his everlasting kingdom. The second parable depicts the history of Israel as a succession of sinful generations that will be punished by God until the final judgment. The third parable portrays the heavenly realm where God dwells with his holy ones, and where the wicked will be cast into a fiery abyss.
- The Book of the Heavenly Luminaries (chapters 72â82) is a detailed account of the astronomical and calendrical system that governs the natural phenomena. It explains how the sun, moon, stars, and seasons operate according to a fixed order that was revealed to Enoch by an angel. It also advocates a solar calendar of 364 days that is opposed to the lunar calendar used by most Jews at that time.
- The Book of Dream Visions (chapters 83â90) consists of two visions that Enoch saw in his dreams. The first vision is about the Genesis flood and how God saved Noah and his family from destruction. The second vision is an allegorical history of Israel from Adam to the Maccabean revolt, using animals to represent different groups of people. The vision ends with a prophecy of a final battle between God's sheep and their enemies, followed by a new creation.
- The Epistle of Enoch (chapters 91â108) is a collection of apocalyptic exhortations and warnings that Enoch addressed to his children and future generations. It covers topics such as wisdom and piety, sin and judgment, resurrection and reward, angels and demons, and signs of the end times. It also includes some legendary material about Enoch's life, such as his birth, his translation to heaven, and his writing activity.

The Book of Enoch is a rich and complex work that reflects the beliefs and concerns of diverse Jewish groups in the Second Temple period. It offers a glimpse into their worldview, their hopes and fears, their struggles and aspirations. It also influenced many Christian writers and thinkers who saw in it a source of inspiration and revelation.
